# Web dev on a tablet using Termux

* Enable wakelock in Termux so that long running operations do not die due to tablet sleeping.
* Install clang to substitute for gcc (https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/407).
* I wanted to install PHP 5 and Termux packages had version 7.
* So downloaded PHP 5 from php.net and installed dependencies
** libxml2
**
